# task-tracker-cli
Task Tracker CLI is a simple command line tool to manage tasks. It lets users add, update, delete, and track tasks (in progress, done, or pending). Tasks are stored in a JSON file in the current directory. No external libraries requiredâ€”just native file system handling and basic error handling.
